hoisting 
This mean java script reserves all the space in memory for variables and functions in memory before executing the code, but functions are accesible even before they are defined but variables are undifined until a value is assigned to them in the code, that is why when you access the variable before is assigned you get an undefined 



Single Threaded, Synchronous Execution
Single Threaded: one comman at a time
Synchronous Execution: one line at a time and in the order it appears 

Invocaition: running/calling a functio, in java script, by using parenthesis()

Execution contex: 
You get a new one every time you get execute a function 

outer environment reference:
global execution contex:
execution stack: 
create phase: 
lexical environtment: 
Scope Chain: 

Scope means: where can I Access the variable 
Chain: are the links or outer environtment references 

coercion: Converting a value from one type to another. This happens quite often in Javascript because it's dynamically typed. 

==	compares even even if the variables are different type because coercion, like 3 - '3', false == 0.
===	

Etrict equality: compares 2 thing and doesnt try to converts the variables. "3" === 3


object literal 
var person ={}, this creates an empty object  

Name space:
A container for variables and functions. Typically to keep variables and functions with the same name separate. 

First class functions:
Everything you can do with other typer you can do with functions. Assign them to variables, pass them around, create them on the fly.

Expresion: 
An unit of code that result in a value. It doesn't have to save to a variable.

valores asocidos con algo vacios regresan un false like  0, undefined, null, ""

cuando se asigana una funcion como el valor de una variable, no es necesario asignarle un nombre porque el nombre de la variable sirve para identificar la seccion de memoria en la que se encuentra la funcion, y el nombre de la viaraible es usado como el nombre de la function 

First class functions:
Functions that can be pass around, created ion the fly, used and varibles can be equal to them 

Mutate: 
to change something, Immutable means it can't be changed. 

By value vs By reference:
To change a value object creating a new memory space use the =
c = { greeting: 'howdy'};

If the value is a primitive in an object literal is called a property, but if the value is a function is called a method.

This 
This relates to the objec in where the function/methos is executing, this makes reference to the object in where the function is executing and will refer to an particular object if its method calls this variable. Makes reference to an object if the method is attached to the object. 

Arguments:
The parameters you pass to a function. Javascript gives you a keyword of the same name which contains them all. 

language = language || 'en'; // if the parameter language is empty it sets to 'en' because valores asocidos con algo vacios regresan un false like  0, undefined, null, ""

Syntax parser: deletes extra spaces and gives format to the text/code.

Function statement:
Are functions happens as a new statement and function is the first word and is loaded in memory and needs to be onvoqued  

Function expression:
could be a variable equal to a function with no name, is not put into memory but create it on the fly 

Immediate invoked function expression (IIFE):
Is a function that is call exactly at after it is created in the same statemente, like quen a variable is equal to a anonimous function and then called by () in the same line. 

Empression:
Something that returns a value

Closures:
The variables that it would normally have reference to anyway even tought these execution contex are gone, this phenomenon of closing in all the variables that is supposed to have access to is called closure. 
This happens when varibles created on a parent related execution contex are accesible from an execution content created inside the execution content parent that is no longer running but variables are in memory. 

Factory:
Is a function that returns or mix other things for me. 

Callback:
Is when a function completes its execution and once is done executes the function it was passed as a parameter. 

Callback function:
A function you give to another function, to be run when the other funtion is finished. So the function you call(i.e. invoke). 'calls back' by calling the function you gave it when it finishes. 

Function currying:
creating a copy of a function but with some preset parameters, very useful in mathematical situations.
