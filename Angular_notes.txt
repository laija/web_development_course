Modules Apps and Controllers 

scope:
Is the special object AngularJS createsand I ask by a dependency injection 

Dependency injection : 
Givin a function an object. Rather than creating an object inside the fuction, you pass it to the function. 

Minification:
Shrinking the size of files for faster download, We normally add '.min' to the name of the file. so 'file.js' becomes 'file.min.js' so we cn tell the difference. 

Interpolation:
Creating a string by combining strings and placeholders. 
'My name is' + name is interpolated, and retults in 'My name is Tony'.

Directive:
An instruction to AngularJS to manipulate a pice of the DOM. They could be 'add a class', 'hide this', 'create this', etc. 

wartchers: 
In the Angular context, keeps track of the original value everytime an even gets trown

Digest loop:
goes trow every single variable  in the watch list to see if something has changed, compares old value to the new value and if one of these things have change then updates everywhere that is connected to it, anything in the DOM, and anywhere in the code, runs again to check if by changing that it might have change something else until all of the old values and the new values match.
