Dependency injection : 
Givin a function an object. Rather than creating an object inside the fuction, you pass it to the function. 


Minification:
Shrinking the size of files for faster download, We normally add '.min' to the name of the file. so 'file.js' becomes 'file.min.js' so we cn tell the difference. 

Interpolation:
Creating a string by combining strings and placeholders. 
'My name is' + name is interpolated, and retults in 'My name is Tony'.
